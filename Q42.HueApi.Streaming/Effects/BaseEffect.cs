  /// 5.3 LightSourceEffect will map a virtual light source to actual lights such that lights close to the virtual light source are more strongly influenced than lights further away from the virual light source. LightSourceEffects have next to an animation for color also an animation for position and radius. Note the difference with the previous effect types: in both AreaEffect and MultiChannelEffect, a light either belongs to an area or channel or not, whereas for the LightSourceEffect itâ€™s a more gradual relation: the closer to the virtual source the more strongly a light is influenced by the source.
